# Rust Multiverse:

a task (tokio) based project where you, the user, spawns multiple universes that fight, friend, communicate with each other.
covers different intermediate rust concepts.

all universes communicate through a server, the "Supervisor" which receives messages and broadcast + Logs the relevant results.

Logger is fully static, the app is pretty dynamic, so I can convert it to a web server at any time.

# Experimental: Web Server Version
